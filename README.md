# File-Handling

Initailly created a text file in notepad.
Then i used try catch method for initially declaring my file as NULL.
So it defaulty shows assigned output.
After that i edited the code by removing closing the scanner file from Try part.
Then it count lines, numbers and characters.
As i used boolean there it shows only false as i used else loop there.
But i constructed my lines as desired lines. Hence it does not validate boolean operation.
